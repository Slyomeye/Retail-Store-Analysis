# Retail-Store-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project using Structure Query Language (SQL) to create insights and analyze the data. The process involved stages like data cleaning, filtering, replacing null values, formating of dates, creating new calculated columns, inserting currencies to values in the columns and updating the dataset with columns using query.
## Objective
The project aims to analyze retail store data transaction details to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer purchasing behavior and product trends.
## [Dataset used]
-<a href= "https://github.com/Slyomeye/Retail-Store-Analysis/blob/main/retail_store_sales.csv">Dataset</a>
 ## Tool used 
-	SQL
I cleaned the data by removing duplicates, formatting date types, removing null values and replacing the null values with new calculated columns to determine the price per unit of products, quantity of products and the total Price of the products as well as replacing the null values in the discount applied column. I also inserted currency to the price per unit column and Total Price column before adding the new columns to my database using queries all through the cleaning process.

## Questions (KPIs)
-	What is the total Number of Transactions?
-	What is the total Revenue generated?
-	Find the sales for each category
-	Find the Category/Product sales per Month
-	What is the most popular payment method used?
-	Which customers have spent the most money patronizing the store?
-	With customer retention analysis, find the customers that are still purchasing from the store and how many purchases made by each customer from their first purchase date.
-	What is the monthly sales trend performance over time?
-	What are the price changes of each category over time?
