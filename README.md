# Retail-Store-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project using Structure Query Language (SQL) to create insights and analyze the data. The process involved stages like data cleaning, filtering, replacing null values, formating of dates, creating new calculated columns and updating the dataset with columns using query.
## Objective
The project aims to analyze retail store data transaction details to uncover insights related to sales performance, product trends and customer purchasing behavior.
